                    <p>I'm 26 years old, I was born in Cali, Colombia, and raised in Palmira. Since I was a little kid
                        I've always been really into artistic and manual stuff, my passion when I was a youngman was
                        playing with clay, i used to do it everyday with my dad, he was the real artist at that time.
                        Since then as any other human I have been going through different circumstances and now I'm a
                        professional Visual Communication Designer from the Javeriana University in Cali, Colombia and
                        nowadays I'm studying Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College in London, Canada, hell a
