                    <h4>Senior Partner</h4>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Giovanni Perruzzi. I was born in London, Ontario. I have been coding since I was
                        in High School. I took computer science courses throughout my time at school. Now I am a student
                        at Fanshawe College, studying Interactive Media Design; this is my second year in the program,
                        and I have learned lots of stuff about Web Development, Design, Branding, and marketing.</p>

                    <h4>Senior Partner</h4>
                    <p>Zeyin is mostly focusing on daily tasks such as cleaning the office, getting lunches and coffee,
                        and delivery meal to the right person in the morning. He is trying his best to help with the
                        design part of the operation but there is not going around to say that his ability is rather
                        limited. So he will be happy to contribute anyway possible.</p>
